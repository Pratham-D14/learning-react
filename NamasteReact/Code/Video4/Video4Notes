# props Destructing

    - same as props but using destructing instead of props.name
    - example on code line 4

# Why we need key while looping through a List

- When there are component at same level then a component should have a unique ID
  if we don't give a unique id and when added a new card/element it will render all the elements present
  because react treats all the element or cards as same.

- If given unique ID it will render only one element/card that is the new element and not all the element present
