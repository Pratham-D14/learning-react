# Video 3 Notes

# JSX is not HTML!

# It's syntax is like HTML or XML

# Javascript Engine only understand ECMAScripts and this is what browser's understand

# Babel is js transpiler. It converts jsx code that js engine will understand

# How JSX Works Behind The Scence

# JSX => React.createElement => Javascript{Object} => HTMLElement(Object) -> \*(converstion happen using Babel)


\* Component in React

1. Class Based Component:
    Old way of writing code,
    It uses Javascript classes,

2. Functional Component:
    New way of writing code,
    It uses Javascript Function,

    Syntax: 
        const FunctionalComponet = () => {
            return <h1>React Functional Component</h1>
        }


# What is Component Composition:
    Component Composition is adding Component into a Component

# Can we use Normal Function:
    Yes, we can also uses normal function also instead of arrowFunction
    const func = function () { return (content);}
    but it's better to use arrow functions

# running Javascript code in component:
    - {} -> using carly braceces you can write any Javascript expression
    - Also call the variable inside your component: 
        example: code line 27 
    - while using this or reading data from frontend JSX while escape the malicious Attack by sanitizing that data
    - {} -> while using this it prevents cross site scripting for us
    - you can also call a functional Component inside {} 
        example: code line 30
